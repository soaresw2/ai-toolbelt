# Optimize Performance

Analyze and optimize the performance of the selected code:

- Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- Reduce unnecessary computations
- Optimize loops and data structures
- Consider caching strategies where appropriate
- Minimize memory allocations
- Use more efficient algorithms if applicable
- Ensure optimizations don't sacrifice code readability significantly
- Benchmark before and after if possible
