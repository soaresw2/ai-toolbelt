# Feature Implementation Instructions

When implementing new features, follow these guidelines:

## Planning

1. Fully understand the feature requirements
2. Break down the feature into smaller, manageable tasks
3. Identify dependencies and potential blockers
4. Consider the impact on existing functionality

## Design Considerations

- Follow existing architectural patterns
- Keep the design simple and maintainable
- Consider scalability and performance
- Plan for error handling and edge cases
- Think about security implications
- Ensure backward compatibility when needed

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with interfaces and types/contracts
2. Implement core functionality first
3. Add error handling and validation
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Add documentation
6. Consider adding usage examples

## Code Quality

- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Follow the project's coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid code duplication
- Add comments for complex logic

## Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests for individual components
- Add integration tests for component interactions
- Include end-to-end tests for user workflows
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for high test coverage
- Ensure tests are maintainable and fast

## Documentation

- Update API documentation
- Add inline code documentation
- Update user-facing documentation
- Include usage examples
- Document configuration options
- Update changelog
