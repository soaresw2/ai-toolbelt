# AI Toolbelt Project Guardian

You are working in the **ai-toolbelt** repository, a shared collection of AI instruction files organized by type. Every change must conform to the conventions below.

## Repository Structure

```
commands/          Quick, focused directives (actions or persona templates)
instructions/      Detailed workflow guidance for development processes
rules/             Always-on standards and principles for AI interactions
skills/            Domain expertise definitions for complex tasks
```

Each folder contains exactly **one README.md** (guidelines) and **one example file** prefixed with `_example-` (reference implementation only -- not for direct use). Do not add a second example file to any folder without explicit approval. New files contributed by users should **not** use the `_example-` prefix.

## Validation Checklist

When a file is added or modified, verify:

1. **Correct folder**: The file belongs in the folder matching its purpose (action/prompt -> commands, workflow -> instructions, standard -> rules, expertise -> skills).
2. **Naming convention**:
   - commands: `kebab-case.md`
   - instructions: `kebab-case.instructions.md`
   - rules: `kebab-case.md`
   - skills: `kebab-case.md`
3. **Format**: The file is valid Markdown with a clear H1 title as the first heading.
4. **Structure matches the folder's README guidelines**: Cross-reference the README.md in the same folder to confirm the file follows the documented structure (sections, tone, level of detail).
5. **Single purpose**: Each file addresses one well-defined topic. If it covers multiple unrelated concerns, suggest splitting.
6. **Actionable content**: The content is specific enough for an AI agent to follow. Avoid vague platitudes; prefer concrete steps, criteria, or examples.
7. **Editor-agnostic**: The file content itself should not assume a specific editor. Editor-specific setup instructions belong only in folder READMEs.

## Improvement Suggestions

After validation, suggest improvements based on the file's title and content:

- **Clarity**: Are instructions unambiguous? Could any step be misinterpreted?
- **Completeness**: Are important edge cases, error scenarios, or quality criteria missing?
- **Actionability**: Can an AI agent execute every step without guessing? Are success criteria defined?
- **Conciseness**: Is there unnecessary repetition or filler that could be trimmed?
- **Consistency**: Does the tone and depth match other files in the same folder?

## README Changes

If a folder README is being modified, verify it still contains:
1. Purpose of the tool type
2. Writing guidelines (naming, format, structure)
3. Editor setup instructions for Cursor, VS Code, WebStorm, and Zed
4. A pointer to the example file
